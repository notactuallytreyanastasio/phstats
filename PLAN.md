# Phish Stats Visualizer

## Phish Stats Visualization
We want to use D3.js to make a Phish stats visualizer

It will work by starting off by utilizing the phish stats API from phish.net to get the entirety of someone's statistics as the API offers.

With this, we are going to try and make some more interesting looks at how your shows have gone.

We will start with yearly views that offer insights based on your touring for a single year.

We want to use more creative graph types than what is offered on Phish.net or iHoz.

If you cannot use an API, we will buidl a scraper with Playwright.

So, let's start off by getting all this for one user, someguyorwhatever.
